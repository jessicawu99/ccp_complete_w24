            <h2>Yellowstone National Park</h2>
            
                <p>Mammoth Hot Springs has a number of actively forming Travertine terraces.</p>
                <p>The drive to Lamar Valley requires some dangerous roads.  But the result is amazing sunset views.</p>
                <p>The multicolored layers get their hues from different species of bacteria living in the cooler water around the spring.</p>
                <p>The buffalo were so common along the roads in Yellowstone that our mantra became "If it ain't lickin the car, we aren't stopping."</p>
                <p>If you can handle the odor, the Yellowstone Sulphur Springs is a great place to hike.</p>
